## RECAP: Data Types / Classes

  
Data Types          | Stores                    | 
--------------------|---------------------------|
real                | floating point numbers    | 
integer             | integers                  |
complex             | Complex numbers           |
factor              | categorical data          | 
character           | strings                   | 
logical             | TRUE or FALSe             | 
NA                  | Missing                   |
NULL                | Empty                     |
Function            | Function type             | 
--------------------|------------------------------

## Vector

- A vector can only contain objects of the same class

```{r }
a <- c(1,2,5.3,6,-2,4) # numeric vector
b <- c("one","two","three") # character vector
c <- c(TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE) #logical vector
```

## Matrices

  - All columns in a matrix must have the same class(numeric, character, etc.) and the same length. The general format is
```{r }
#mymatrix <- matrix(vector, nrow=r, ncol=c, byrow=FALSE,
#dimnames=list(char_vector_rownames, char_vector_colnames)) 
#byrow=TRUE indicates that the matrix should be filled by rows
```

## Factors
 - Used to represent categorical data. 
 - Can be unordered or ordered.
    -A factor is like an integer vector where each integer has a label.
```{r }
  x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"))
  x
```



## Missing Values
 - Missing values are represented by the symbol **NA** (not available)
 - Impossible values (e.g., dividing by zero) are represented by the symbol NaN (not a number)

 - Can be unordered or ordered.
    -A factor is like an integer vector where each integer has a label.
```{r }
  x <- NA
 # is.na(x) # returns TRUE of x is missing
# mean(x, na.rm=TRUE) # exclude missing in functions
# complete.cases() #returns the number of complete cases

```

## Data Frames

 - More general than a matrix, has different columns and can have different modes (numeric, character, factor, etc.)
 - Used to store tabular data
 - Can store data of different classes
 - *read.table()* or *read.csv()* – used to load dataframes
 
## Create Data Frames
```{r }
data.frame(foo = 1:4, bar = c(T, T, F, F))
x <- c(1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
y <- c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i")
df <- data.frame(x=x, y=y)
```


* * *
```{r }
print(df)
class(df)
```


## Datasets
- R works with different types of datasets 
- Base R functions *read.table* , *read.csv* and *read.delim* can read in data stored as text files, delimited by *almost anything* 
- Data from other stat packages can be read using  *foreign package?* and *Hmisc package* 
\newline
  *read.xlsx(file, sheetIndex=1) #excel files* \newline
  *read.dta(file)# stata files*

## .RDA Data 
 - R Data type
 - Can be created from other data sets 
    -data <- load("profit.rda") 
    -Saving a data frame as an rda
   - Save(data.frame, “dataset.rda”) 
   
## Examples: 1

```{r }
# Reading data from SPSS using the package "foreign"
library(foreign)
data1<-read.spss("D:/F-STAR/data/experim.sav", to.data.frame=TRUE)
data1
```

## Examples: 2

```{r }
# Reading data from STATA using the package "foreign"
data2<-read.dta("D:/F-STAR/data/cr4.dta")
data2
```

## Export to csv

- Use *write.csv* to export data frames 
```{ }
write.csv(Your DataFrame,"Path to export the DataFrame\\
File Name.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

```{r }
write.csv(data2,"D:/F-STAR/data/cr4.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

## Importing data from excel, csv

-This is the most common format we use
-Data files saved in excel can be saved in the several formats:

```{ }
.xlsx #Excel format -
.csv  #comma seperate values
.txt #tab delimited
```
- data must always first be organized in the right format see- Broman and Woo, 2017

    Link: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989

## Example

```{r }
read.csv("D:/F-STAR/data/cr4.csv")
```

## Paths

- Note that when importing your data you must know where the file is
- Helps you tell the computer where to find the data
![RSTUDIO](path.png)


- Absolute path

## Paths
- Types of paths
  - Absolute path -fixed and things must always be in the location specified
  - Relative path- allows you to move entire folders and retain folder structure 
- It is best to create workspace/ projects using Rstudio
- This allows you to move folders and retain folder structure

## Importing using Absolute path

```{r }
# reading a txt file
# read.table("D:/F-STAR/data/cr4.txt")
```


```{r }
# reading a excel file
library(readxl)
read_xlsx("D:/F-STAR/data/cr4.xlsx",sheet=1, col_names = TRUE)

```

## Importing using relative path
- Here use either the Rstudio Projects or set working directory *setwd* approach

```{r }
# Set working directory
# read_xlsx("D:/F-STAR/data/cr4.xlsx",sheet=1)
setwd("D:/F-STAR")
read_xlsx("data/cr4.xlsx",sheet=1,col_names = TRUE)
```
